# NYCDA Angular 102 Homework
This repository belongs to Jim Lynch. 

It contains all homeworks, workshops, and other code code written by Jim for the Feb - Apr 2016 session of the AngularJS class at New York Code and Design Academy, taught by George Dagher.

Excellent class. I miss it sometimes. :)
