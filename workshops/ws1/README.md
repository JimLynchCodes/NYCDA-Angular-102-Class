# Workshop 1

The assignment was to make a form with 3 text fields: first name, last name, and email address.

The email address is never editable, but clicking the edit button will allow you to edit the first name and last name. 
If you click save, the new values are stored in regular text (non-editable), but if you click cancel then the old values of first name and last name are restored.
